# S1-HW-HORISEON-EXAMPLE-SITE
This is the repository for the first homework assignment in our coding bootcamp.
The assignment involved using a pre built website on which to practice refracting code.
The HTML file has been adjusted to use semantic elements for clearer understanding of the page layout.
And the classes in the HTML file have also been joined into more precise groups in order to clean up the selectors used in the CSS file.
This project was also intended as added practice for creating a functioning site from our github account.
Other changes such commenting in the CSS file was added to allow for a better understanding of the code.
Below you will find a URL for the live site as well as a screen shot of what it should look like.
